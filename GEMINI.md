This project is a showcase of various front-end projects. It is a single-page application that lists all the sub-projects.

Fixed the link to the weather card project to be clickable.

Restyled the entry point page to be more 'AI-like' and added a dark/bright theme toggle.

Added a margin to the project list to give more space for the theme switcher and replaced the clickable list item with a button to allow users to read the description before navigating to the project page.

Adjusted the spacing on the main page to improve mobile layout and reduce the gap between the title and the project list.

Made the project list more artistic with a theme-adaptive flashing card animation.

Improved the visibility of the flashing card animation in dark mode by using a more vibrant color.

Added a comprehensive, responsive footer to all pages, including a new privacy policy page and contact information.

Refactored the footer into a modular, reusable component loaded via JavaScript to improve maintainability.

Fixed the alignment of the social media icon in the footer on the entry point page.

Added a hyperlink to the 'Powered by Gemini-CLI' text in the footer, linking to the Gemini home page.

Updated the hyperlink for 'Powered by Gemini-CLI' in the footer to point to the official Gemini CLI documentation.

Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude all files except `.html`, `.js`, and `GEMINI.md` from version control.
